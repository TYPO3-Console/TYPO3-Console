## Installation from Source

Prior to contributing to TYPO3 Console, you must be able to run the test suite.
To achieve this, you need to acquire the TYPO3 Console source code:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/typo3_console.git`
2. Download the [`composer.phar`](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar) executable
3. Run Composer to get the dependencies: `cd typo3_console && php ../composer.phar install`

You can run the test suite by executing `.Build/bin/phpunit` when inside the
typo3_console directory. Please note, that some of these tests need a database connection
with a database user that is allowed to create databases. By default user `root` with no password is used.

The name of the created database is `travis_console_test`. You can change the username,
 password and database name by setting the following environment variables accordingly
 prior to executing the phpunit command, on bash, e.g. like this:
 
```bash
export TYPO3_INSTALL_DB_USER=root
export TYPO3_INSTALL_DB_PASSWORD=root
export TYPO3_INSTALL_DB_DBNAME=my_console_test_db
```

Before you submit a pull request with a new or changed command,
make sure you run `Scripts/typo3console commandreference:render` beforehand
and include the changes in the PR
