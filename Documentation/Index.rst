TYPO3 Console ships many commands to execute TYPO3 actions, which otherwise would only be accessible via the TYPO3 backend.
This makes TYPO3 Console a perfect companion for development, deployment, Docker setups, continuous integration
workflows or anything else where automation is required or beneficial.
