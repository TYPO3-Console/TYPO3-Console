Command Reference
=================

.. note::

   This reference uses `typo3cms` as the command to invoke. If you are on
   Windows, this will probably not work, there you need to use `typo3cms.bat`
   instead. In Composer based installations, the `typo3cms` binary will be
   located in the binary directory specified in the root composer.json (by
   default `vendor/bin`)


The following reference was automatically generated from code.



Application Options
-------------------

The following options can be used with every command:

`--help|-h`
   Display this help message

`--quiet|-q`
   Do not output any message

`--verbose|-v|-vv|-vvv`
   Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

`--ansi`
   Force ANSI output

`--no-ansi`
   Disable ANSI output

`--no-interaction|-n`
   Do not ask any interactive question

**Set up all active extensions**

Sets up all extensions that are marked as active in the system.

This command is especially useful for deployment, where extensions
are already marked as active, but have not been set up yet or might have changed. It ensures every necessary
setup step for the (changed) extensions is performed.
As an additional benefit no caches are flushed, which significantly improves performance of this command
and avoids unnecessary cache clearing.

This can be used in `composer.json` scripts to ensure that extensions
are always set up correctly after a composer run on development systems,
but does not fail on packaging for deployment where no database connection is available.

Besides that, it can be used for a first deploy of a TYPO3 instance in a new environment,
but also works for subsequent deployments.
