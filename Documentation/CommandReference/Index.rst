Command Reference
=================

.. note::

   This reference uses `typo3cms` as the command to invoke. If you are on
   Windows, this will probably not work, there you need to use `typo3cms.bat`
   instead. In Composer based installations, the `typo3cms` binary will be
   located in the binary directory specified in the root composer.json (by
   default `vendor/bin`)


The following reference was automatically generated from code.

`--help|-h`
