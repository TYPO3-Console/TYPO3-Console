Command Reference
=================

.. note::

   This reference uses `typo3` as the command to invoke. If you are on
   Windows, this will probably not work, there you need to use `typo3.bat`
   instead. In Composer based installations, the `typo3` binary will be
   located in the binary directory specified in the root composer.json (by
   default `vendor/bin`)

The following reference was automatically generated from code.

Application Options
-------------------

The following options can be used with every command:

`--help|-h`

`--verbose|-v|-vv|-vvv`
   Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
