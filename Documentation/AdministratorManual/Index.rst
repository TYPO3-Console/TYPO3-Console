======================
Administrator's Manual
======================


Describes how to manage the extension from an administrator’s point of view.
That relates to Page/User TSconfig, permissions, configuration etc., which
administrator level users have access to.

Language should be non/semi-technical, explaining, using small examples.

Target group: **Administrators**, **Developers**



Installation
============

There are two ways to properly install the extension. Using git to clone the
the repository is deprecated and most likely will not work any more in the near
future.


1. Composer installation
------------------------

In case you use Composer to manage dependencies of your TYPO3 project, you can
just issue the following Composer command in your project root directory::

   composer require helhum/typo3-console

The `typo3cms` binary will be installed by Composer in the specified bin-dir
(by default `vendor/bin`).

In case you are unsure how to create a Composer based TYPO3 project, you can
check out this `TYPO3 distribution
<https://github.com/helhum/TYPO3-Distribution>`_, which already provides TYPO3
Console integration.


2. Installation with Extension Manager
--------------------------------------

For the extension to work, it **must** be installed in the `typo3conf/ext/`
directory **not** in any other possible extension location. This is the default
location when downloading it from TER with the Extension Manager.

The `typo3cms` script will be copied to your TYPO3 root directory, when you
activate it. When you symlink the `typo3cms` script to a location of your
preference, TYPO3 Console will work, even when it is not marked as active in
the Extension Manager.



Shell auto complete
===================

You can get shell auto completion by using the great `autocomplete package
<https://github.com/bamarni/symfony-console-autocomplete>`_.
Install the package and make the binary available in your path. Please read the
installation instructions of this package on how to do that.

To temporary activate auto complete in the current shell session, type `eval
"$(symfony-autocomplete --aliases=typo3cms)"` You can also put this into your
`.profile` or `.bashrc` file to have it always available. Auto completion is
then always dynamic and reflects the commands you have available in your TYPO3
installation.
