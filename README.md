TYPO3 Console provides a clean way to register commands and
a sane way to call these commands through a command line tool called `typo3cms`.

It ships many commands to execute TYPO3 actions, which otherwise would only be accessible via the TYPO3 backend. This makes TYPO3 Console a perfect companion for development, deployment, Docker setups, continuous integration workflows or anything else where automation is required or beneficial.

Examples for such commands are:

* `typo3cms install:setup` to completely set up TYPO3 from command line
* `typo3cms upgrade:all` to execute upgrades from command line
* `typo3cms extension:setupactive` to set up all active extensions (database schema update, data import, â€¦)

## Features
* TYPO3 installation and upgrades from command line
* Flexible bootstrap for commands (not every command needs a fully bootstrapped framework)
* Reliable cache flush commands
* Many commands useful for deployment
* Support for command controllers and Symfony commands registered within TYPO3 extensions and Composer packages

## Installation

### Installation using Composer

The recommended way to install TYPO3 Console is by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

    composer require helhum/typo3-console

The `typo3cms` binary will be installed by Composer in the specified `bin-dir` (by default `vendor/bin`).
TYPO3 Console is a perfect companion for Composer-based, enjoyable [TYPO3 projects](https://github.com/helhum/TYPO3-Distribution).

### Installation as extension from TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER)

Download and install the extension with the *Extensions* module.
For the extension to work, it **must** be installed in the `typo3conf/ext` directory **not** in any other extension location.
This directory **must not** be a symlink to another location!
The `typo3cms` command line tool will be copied into the installation root directory during activation.

## Submit bug reports or feature requests
