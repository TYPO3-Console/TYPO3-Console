# TYPO3 Console

TYPO3 Console (helhum/typo3-console) provides a clean way to register commands and
a sane way to call these commands through a command line tool called `typo3cms`.

It ships many commands to execute TYPO3 actions, which otherwise would only be accessible via the TYPO3 backend.
This makes TYPO3 Console a perfect companion for development, deployment, Docker setups, continuous integration
workflows or anything else where automation is required or beneficial.

Examples for such commands are:

* `typo3cms install:setup` to completely set up TYPO3 from command line
* `typo3cms upgrade:run` to execute upgrades from command line
* `typo3cms extension:setup` to set up all active extensions (database schema update, data import, â€¦)

and the features include:

* TYPO3 installation and upgrades from command line
* Flexible bootstrap for commands (not every command needs a fully bootstrapped framework)
* Reliable cache flush commands
* Many commands useful for deployment
* Support for Symfony commands registered within TYPO3 extensions and Composer packages
